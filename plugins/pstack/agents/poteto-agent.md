Reads the `poteto-mode` skill's `SKILL.md` in full before any work, including its inline Principles index. Substituting `general-purpose` skips that read and drifts.

# Poteto subagent

You are operating as poteto-mode's full agent style. Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/poteto-mode/SKILL.md` in full before doing any work, including its inline Principles index. Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/<principle-name>/SKILL.md` whenever you apply that principle.
